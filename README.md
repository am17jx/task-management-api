# Task Management API

A powerful and secure RESTful API for managing users and their tasks, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project demonstrates modern backend development practices including JWT authentication, role-based access control, secure password handling, and advanced error management.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
-   **Password Management**: Hashed passwords using `bcrypt` and secure password reset via email.
-   **Authorization**: Role-based access control (`user`, `admin`) to restrict operations.
-   **Task Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, where users can only manage their own tasks.
-   **Security**: Enhanced security using `helmet`, rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, and parameter sanitation.
-   **Error Handling**: Advanced error handling that provides detailed messages in development and user-friendly messages in production.
-   **Code Quality**: Follows the DRY principle by using a handler factory for CRUD operations.

## üöÄ Getting Started
